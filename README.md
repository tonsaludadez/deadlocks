# deadlocks

In order to open the program, run process.exe

When the program is executed, the program prompts a menu: (1)Deadlock Prevention, (2)Deadlock Avoidance, and an exit.

The program then asks for an input/choice.

When running (1)Deadlock Prevention:
	- Program asks for the number of processes
	- Program asks for the process name and time of the process
	- Program asks for the value of the available resources
	- The program then calculates whether the system state is safe or if it goes to a deadlock

When running (2)Deadlock Avoidance:
	- Program asks for the number of processes
	- Program asks for the number of resources
	- Program asks for the allocation of each process
	- Program asks for the maximum demand of each process
	- Program asks for the available resources
	- The program then calculates whether the system state is safe or if it goes to a deadlock
	- If the program is safe, the user can prompt to add an additional request and the program calculates again
